    ________SHORT ORDER__________

    72 Hour Game dev competition
    Scott "Impossible" Anderson

    --------REQUIRMENTS--------------

      Some version of Windows. 
      DirectX 7 or higher. 
      A video card that supports 320x240x32. 

       That should be it. The game was built with Visual Studio .NET so you may need the VC7 runtimes as well. I have no idea about the
      stability of the game.  If you don't meet the requirements it will probably crash, but I don't think the
      requirements are very steep.  

    ----------GAMEPLAY---------------

      In Short Order you are a short order cook making burgers,cheesburgers and fried eggs for the hungry customers.  

    *--Controls:

       Right click to change you current item.
      Left click on the grill to place the current item you want to cook.
      Left click on a flashing text item to perform the action the flashing text says (flip,cheese or serve). 

    *--Orders:

       On the left side you have a list of orders. Because the people that go to fast food restaurants aren't 
      very patient they will only stay around for 11 seconds before their order is invalid. This means you need 
      to hurry with your orders. An order is not complete until you serve it.

    *--Cooking:

       Once you have flashing text over an item you need to click on it as fast as possible.  If you don't attend to 
      a cooking burger or egg it will burn on the grill and you have to start cooking that item over. Items that aren't
      in the order list will just vanish into nowhere, but you won't be penalized for cooking them. 

    *--Scoring:

      If if lose an order your score will go down by 5 points and the customer's face 
      will be sad.  
     
      If you complete an order your score is increase by 10 and the customers face will be happy.

      If you burn some food you will lose 1 point.
